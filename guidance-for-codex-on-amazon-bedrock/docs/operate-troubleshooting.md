# Operate — Troubleshooting

Known failure modes across the deploy paths. Not exhaustive — add entries as new failure modes surface.

Symptoms are grouped by path. The **All paths** section applies
regardless of how you deployed.

---

## All paths

### `bedrock:InvokeModel` returns `AccessDeniedException`
- **Likely cause:** the caller's role has the Bedrock customer-managed
  policy attached, but the session doesn't match the trust policy's
  `aws:PrincipalArn` condition (`AWSReservedSSO_CodexBedrockUser_*`).
- **Fix:** verify `aws sts get-caller-identity` returns an ARN matching the
  permission-set name baked into the stack. If you renamed the permission
  set, redeploy `bedrock-auth-idc.yaml` with the new
  `PermissionSetNamePrefix` parameter.

### Model ID returns 404 / `ResourceNotFoundException`
- **Likely cause:** the model ID in `~/.codex/config.toml` (or gateway
  `litellm_config.yaml`) is not available in the target region, or it is
  only served through the mantle endpoint (GPT-5.4) and you are calling
  standard Converse, or vice versa.
- **Fix:** verify the model ID against the region matrix in
  [reference-regions.md](reference-regions.md). `openai.gpt-oss-120b-1:0`
  and similar models use standard Converse; `gpt-5.4` uses the mantle
  endpoint.

### CloudTrail `userIdentity.principalId` shows assumed-role ARN, not SSO username
- **Expected.** The SSO username is in `userIdentity.onBehalfOf` or is
  parsed from the assumed-role session name (`...:<sso-username>`). CUR
  2.0's `line_item_iam_principal` column contains the full assumed-role
  ARN; join on the session-name suffix for per-user attribution.

## IdC path

### `aws sso login` opens browser but Codex still fails with expired creds
- **Likely cause:** the `credential_process` helper (`codex-sso-creds`) raced
  the browser sign-in — Codex made its SDK call before the SSO cache was
  populated.
- **Fix:** re-run the Codex prompt. This is documented as expected UX in
  `DEV-SETUP.md`. If it persists, check that `~/.aws/sso/cache/` contains a fresh
  JSON blob with a future `expiresAt`.

### Using `aws login` (console-login) profiles instead of `aws sso login`
- **Requires:** Codex ≥ 0.130.0 (PR #21623 enabled the SDK's
  `credentials-login` feature so `login_session` profiles resolve for Bedrock
  SigV4 signing).
- **Fix for older Codex:** upgrade to ≥ 0.130.0, or use an `aws sso login`
  profile.

### `codex-sso-creds` works from terminal but not from the Codex desktop app / VS Code
- **Likely cause:** GUI apps on macOS launch with a minimal PATH; the
  helper cannot find `aws`.
- **Fix:** the shipped helper probes Apple-Silicon + Intel Homebrew,
  MacPorts, Linuxbrew, pip-user, and system paths, plus
  `launchctl getenv PATH` as a fallback. If none resolve, symlink `aws`
  into `/usr/local/bin` or add an explicit path in the helper's candidate
  list.

## Gateway (LiteLLM) path

### `cloudformation delete-stack` on `codex-litellm-gateway` hangs on RDS
- **Cause:** `DeletionProtection: true` on the RDS instance — CloudFormation cannot
  delete it until protection is cleared.
- **Fix:**
  ```bash
  aws rds modify-db-instance \
    --db-instance-identifier <id> \
    --no-deletion-protection --apply-immediately
  ```
  Then retry the stack delete.

### Gateway `POST /v1/chat/completions` from outside the VPC times out
- **Cause:** ALB `AllowedCidr` defaults to `10.0.0.0/16` — by design, the
  gateway is internal-only.
- **Fix:** either deploy a bastion or connect through the corporate VPN, or
  temporarily add a `/32` ingress rule to the ALB security group, then remove it afterward.

### LiteLLM returns `400` with `"LLM Provider NOT provided"`
- **Cause:** the `model` parameter in the request does not match an alias
  in `litellm_config.yaml`.
- **Fix:** use one of the aliases defined in the embedded config (e.g.
  `gpt-oss-120b`), or rebuild the image after editing the config.

## Observability (OTel → CloudWatch)

### No metrics in `/aws/codex/metrics` after a Codex session
- **Checklist:**
  1. `curl <collector-alb>/v1/metrics` with an `x-user-id` header — does the
     synthetic POST arrive? If not, the collector or networking is broken.
  2. Verify that `~/.codex/config.toml` has an `[otel.exporter.otlp-http]`
     block with the *full* URL (Codex does not append `/v1/<signal>`).
  3. Verify Codex version ≥ 0.130 — older versions emit a different
     set of metric names than `otel-collector.yaml` declares.
  4. Wait at least 60 seconds — the batch processor flushes on an interval.

### Metrics land but `user.id` dimension is empty or `$USER` placeholder
- **Cause:** `install.sh` ran before an SSO session was cached, so it fell
  back to `$USER` as the `x-user-id` header value.
- **Fix:** re-run `install.sh` after a successful `aws sso login`; the
  bundle regenerates the header from `sts:GetCallerIdentity`.

### Collector logs show `404` on `/v1/logs` or `/v1/traces`
- **Cause:** Codex emits logs and traces alongside metrics; the collector
  needs `nop`-exporter pipelines for those signals so clients do not retry
  on 4xx responses. If you see this, redeploy with the current
  `otel-collector.yaml`.
